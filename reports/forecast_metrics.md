# Traffic Forecasting Model Evaluation Report

>This report summarizes the evaluation of short-horizon traffic forecasting models for the corridor. It includes baseline comparisons, machine learning results, and next steps for improvement.

## üìä Evaluation Metrics
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Measures average prediction error
- **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**: Measures average percentage error
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: Penalizes larger errors
- **Mean Delay per Vehicle**: Proxy for congestion
- **Rolling Origin Cross-Validation**: Robust time series evaluation

---

## üèÅ Baseline Models
- **Last Value**: Uses previous value as prediction
- **Seasonal Naive**: Uses value from previous period (e.g., same time last week)

---

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Models
- **XGBoost/LightGBM**: Tree-based models with lagged features
- **LSTM/TFT (TODO)**: Deep learning for time series

## üìã Results Interpretation

The XGBoost model was trained on enriched traffic features and evaluated on a held-out test set. The following metrics summarize its performance:

- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error) = 0.125**: On average, the model's predictions differ from the actual queue length by 0.125 units. This indicates a low average error, suggesting the model is able to capture short-term traffic patterns effectively.
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) = 0.354**: The RMSE penalizes larger errors more than MAE. The relatively low RMSE value further confirms that the model is not making large mistakes on the test set.

Overall, these results show that the XGBoost model is able to forecast queue length with reasonable accuracy given the available features and data. Further improvements may be possible by further tuning hyperparameters, adding more features, or using more advanced models.
